Hi 

Please read 
"Readme_WeatherPack" pdf or rtf version carefully (at least the first page so you'll get the menu working :D ). 


Hope you'll be happy with the effects. Modify them however much you want or use them as they are. 
And if you got any questions just email.

Be sure to get all future updates! 

1.0 was first version (with legacy particle engine)
1.1 THIS VERSION (updated to Shuriken versions plus added more effects)
1.2 likely May/June, 
1.3 likely September
and 1.4 still during year 2012.
